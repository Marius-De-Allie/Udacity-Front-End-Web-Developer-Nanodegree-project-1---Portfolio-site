        <p class="intro-text">My name is Marius De Allie. I am a Front end web
          developer.<br>I am very passionate about web and software development.<br>
          I think that I was attracted to development because I enjoy creating<br>
          things and love problem solving. I initially got introduced to
          development/programming<br>in high school when we started coding in
          Microsoft QBasic, for many years<br> I never pursued development
          until maybe a year and a half ago when I had the revelation<br>to
          focus in on development and acquire some dev skills as I felt that<br>
          I was ready to make the committment to becoming a full time
          web/JavaScript developer.<br>I saw that web/software development was
          something that I was passionate about and could see myself doing<br>as career for
          the next 25 to 30 years, as I really enjoy<br>taking on new challenges
          and finding solutions to problems that are<br>presented to me, I felt
          that this problem solving aspect of development really appealed to me<br>
          and the ability to be able to create apps/websites that could be<br>
          consumed by others and have my work have an impact on others was a<br>
          great feeling that would always challeng me to get better at my craft.
          Alos the fact that are many different paths you can take to get to the
          same end goal is one of the things I love about development.<br>I also
          love the fact that as a developer you are always learning
          and honing your<br> skills, no matter how many years of experience you
          have you are always learning new components of the programming
          language that you choose.
