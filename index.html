        <p class="intro-text">My name is Marius De Allie and I am a Front end web
          developer. I am very passionate about web and software development.
          I was attracted to development because I enjoy creating things and love problem solving.
        </P>
        <p class="intro-text">
          I initially got exposed to development/programming way back in high school when
          my IT class at the time started coding in the Microsoft QBasic language. For several I
          was not focused on development/coding, as I worked in a various IT support roles within
          the retail, engineering and food processing industires.Througout those years working in IT
          support I was not drawn back to development,
          until around the year 2016, when I began doing some SQL databse querying and fell in love
          with it, as a result I proceeded to get
          Microsoft certfiications in T-SQL 2012 and T-SQL 2016 Querying and development.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          This began the process toward my new found love for development and coding. I was
          very much attracted to the problem solving aspect of SQL querying and as a result
          that opened my eyes to other programming languages. Eventually this curiousity
          and passion to delve deeper into programming/development lead me to begin learning Microsoft
          C# as my first object oriented language in late 2018. From there I discovered Udacity's
          excellent Nanodegree programs that focused on different disciples of tech.
          I enrolled in Udacity's Intro to programming 4 month Nanodegree program so that I could get a
          more formal introduction to general programming before deciding on an area or language to specialize in.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          Upon completing the intro to programming Nanodegree is when I reached that turning point,
          I had a revelation, this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life...I wanted to be a developer.
          This is when I made the committment to becoming a full time time developer and was
          ready and very excited to move forward on this new adventure. I enrolled in Udacity's Front End Web developer
          Nanodegree and soon fell in love with JavaScript and my love for development grew even more.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          I am so very passionate about web and software development.
          I really enjoy taking on new challenges and finding solutions to problems
          that are presented to me. It is this problem solving aspect of development
          that really appealed to me and led to my great love and passion for
          coding. The ability to be able to create apps/websites that can be
          consumed by others and to have my work have an impact on others is a great feeling.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          I feel that development/programming is one of the few career paths that would afford me the
          opportunity to remain engaged and be challenged for many many years to come.
          The fact that as a developer you are always learning
          and honing your skills, no matter how many years of experience you
          have, you are always learning new components of your primary programming
          language, as well as always finding ways to make you code more efficient and learning
          new languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.
          Another very appealing aspect of development for me is, the fact that to get to the same objective or end goal,
          there are many different routes you can take which allows you to bring your own personal
          touch to your code and creations.
